I started making my own paint clone to run in the browser a few months ago, and despite the fact that it's definitely not ready for prime time I decided to push it to an externally visible url. The current instance is visible [here][1]. Of course the first step in building a project is naming the project, everything after that is just "coding it up". So I settled on "Yet Another Paint Clone" for now. Although quite a mouthful it abbreviates to "Why a PC?" The only reason I still use a PC is the Linux program [Kolourpaint][2]. Otherwise I have converted my workflow 100% to Chromebooks, so the cumbersome name is good for now.

Above is a screenshot illustrating many of the programs capabilities. Full current features are:

* Open/Save images to localstorage

* Save images as png (right click -&gt; "save image as...")

* Foreground/background colors (fully supported for fill, brush, circle, rectangle, and eye dropper)

* Paint brush with custom size (unlabeled number input at bottom of tools)

* Paint bucket (algorithm adopted from [William Malone's blog][3])

* Select tool (currently only for moving a selection around)

* Rect and circle tool

* Canvas resizer

* Eye Dropper (color selector)

That's about it for now. Hopefully I'll have a functional version with file IO and a more smooth interface by the end of February. Stay Tuned.
