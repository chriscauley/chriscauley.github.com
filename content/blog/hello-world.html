I'm finally relaunching my blog using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/). I previously hosted this blog using Jekyll and I briefly played around with Hexo. I finally settled on Pelican primarily because it's based in python, the server side language I am most familiar with.

My transition started because I newly obsessed with [riot.js](http://riotjs.com) and want to include riot in the blog rather than using a thrid party service. Jekyll renders using markdown, which preserves HTML, but on with standard tags. It treats my custom tags ([ur-tabs](/simple-riot-js-tabs-widget.html), markdown, ur-form, etc.) as text and escapes the special characters (greater than and less than). 

I then switched to Hexo which is in javascript, a language I know fairly well and actually want to learn (unklike Jekyll's Ruby). But after many hours of tweaking it I couldn't get it just right. Specifically I had the opposite problem, I wanted to escape certain HTML characters but was unable to. For example, look at this code sample:
</markdown>

<pre><code class="html">
{% filter escape %}
<div></div>
{% endfilter %}
</code></pre>

<markdown>
To make somthing like this I'd need a lot of &amp;gt; and &amp;lt; characters which is tedious and annoying. By default Pelican (and also Hexo) supports using markdown or html files, which are served with minimal processing. But Pelican renders the surrounding blog using Jinja2. I wanted more complex logic. Using my [modified JinjaReader](/updated-using-jinja2-in-pelican-templates.html) I can first render the templates with Jinja2. The above code sample was actually generated using the `filter escape` template tags.
</markdown>

<pre><code class="html">
{% filter escape -%}
{% raw -%}
<pre><code class="html">
{% filter escape %}
<div></div>
{% endfilter %}
</code></pre>
{% endraw %}
{% endfilter %}
</code></pre>

<markdown>
I'll go into the other technical difficulties here at a later date, but the other big issue I had was deploying to github. Pelican is traditionally deployed using the ghp-import command, which transfers a given directory to a branch. Specifically, because this is a github user page I needed to move the source material to a different branch (specifically source) and then deploy using the following command.
</markdown>

<pre><code class="bash">
{% filter escape %}
ghp-import -b master output/
git push origin master
{% endfilter %}
</pre></code>

<p>That's it for now... Don't really know how to end blog these things... so um... Jinja2 whitespace coming soon!</p>
