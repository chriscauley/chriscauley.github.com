      While Ws do exist in nature, most Ws are man made. Four of the letter U are consumed to produce every letter W: two Us in construction of the letter itself and an additional two Us to spell the word "Doubl U". First a Uologist constructs a Tripl U which exists only for fractions of seconds as the element Uuu, which takes 7 Us to synthecize by the time you write out Unununium. This has the atomic number 111 because it is comprised of 3x1 letters U. These trimers then decay to Ws, the word Unununium falls apart because it is just silly, and the waste Us are carefully collected and distributed to people too lazy to write "you" in a text message. Recently, physicists at CERN have theorized that a stable quatremer of the letter U (a quadroupl U) may occur when a black hole gets wriggity wrecked, but none have been observed in nature since black holes stopped drinking after that one night Monica's house.

    <dd>
      W is the only letter which has more than one syllable, unless you are reciting the alphabet in which case "Y and Z" both have 1.5 syllables. The longest word that can only be spelled with only Ws is "www", which clocks in at an astonishing 9 syllables and no vowels. The word "www", as well as the entire internet, was made by the government to subsidize U farmers and the W industrial complex. Since "www" stands for a the three syllable phrase "world wide web", the letter W is often times used by satirists as a metaphor for goverment waste and the inefficiency of social programs.
