      Since E is the most frequent letter in the English language (as well as most lesser languages), most people assume that E must also be the most abundant letter. But e, like all vowels, are only created naturally in the last moments before a star goes supernova or a black hole goes double-super-no-backsies-nova. The abundance of the letter E is actually very low, even for a vowel. The only reason why E's can be used so frequently is due to letter recycling. Every E ever mined still in circulation, with the one notable exception being the dozen or so E's left on Venus during Russia's Venera missions.
