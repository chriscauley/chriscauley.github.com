I just finished Biocentrism by Robert Lanza and throughout the book I took issue with one key point. Despite being a hardened nihilist, I actually agree with him on many of the new-age and mystical themes: reality as we know it is a construct of consciousness and that it is meaningless to talk of a universe without addressing the bio-centric lens that we view it. However he views the collapse of quantum waveforms as the locus of this paradox while I think this is still an entirely philosophical problem which is merely highlighted by quantum oddities. The entire book I thought maybe it was my own bias that reject biocentrism. Maybe it is just my hatred of the anthropocentric philosophy I was raised with. Maybe I'm just taking the words of my teachers, most notably [PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g), who claim that there is no reason to assume human perception is the "observer" in quantum collapse rather than other matter perturbing the quantum system. But in the final chapter I believe he proved my point and destroyed one of the major tenants of biocentrism.

<blockquote> "... the proposed scaled up superposition experiment will see whether the weird quantum effects observed at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic levels apply just as strongly in truly large macroscopic structures, at the level of tables and chairs. It would be interesting to confirm or deny that macroscopic objects literally exist in more than one state or place simultaneously until perturbed in some way, after which the collapse out of superposition to just one outcome. There are many reasons this might not happen experimentally, <b>chief among them the noise (interference from light, organism, etc)</b>, but whatever outcome occurs it should be revelatory." (emphasis added)</blockquote>

Here I think he unintentionally admits that quantum collapse is not only caused by human observation, but observation by interference with any un-entangled, second quantum system. These entangled, uncollapsed systems are tricky to work with because they require isolating a photon, electron, alpha particle, or even bucky ball from the rest of the universe. The larger the object, the harder superposition is to maintain, which is why the quantum effects of photons are easy to observe while that of buckyballs is tricky and that of chairs is impossible (or at least one of the reasons). To improve these experiments scientists need to further isolate objects, bring them to increasingly lower temperatures, and fine tune every aspect of the experiment.

If human observation (as opposed to observation by an external radio source or detector) were the true mechanism for quantum collapse, we would need only to leave the room a bit longer. But no experiment has ever been improved by scientists taking a longer lunch or reading the results more slowly. If biological observation was the source of the collapse then quantum computers could be improved by putting them in separate buildings, sanitizing the room surrounding the experimental apparatus, or even performing them on satellites rather than the earth. But I've yet to hear of D-Wave requiring their employees to stop thinking about D-Wave while the computers are running to avoid decoherence. (although I admit that in a biocentric universe they would keep such a policy a secret to protect their intellectual property)

I fully agree that the universe may not exists when we aren't looking at it. But I do not include quantum collapse in this philosophical problem. Humans never actually observe quantum experiments. Single photons are passed through slits, split in crystals, bounced off or passed through mirrors, and logged on detectors. This is then chronicled as data streams, analyzed and processed into graphs, which are represented by further signal processing terminating in LED's lighting up and translating the signal into light. This still is not "observation by consciousness" because the graph is meaningless until the light is passed into a human eye, attenuated by optics, absorbed by rods and cones, shot through endless passages of neurons, interpreted through many more layers of data processing by the brain and then contemplated by a trained scientist. If a cat, child, president, or Nobel Prize winning biologist sees these, the quantum effects have still not been "observed" by biological consciousness unless that cat, child, president, or biologist happens to be trained in the school of quantum mechanics. But the graph appears the same to all or even to a non-thinking analog camera. Clearly the results do not depend on the observer.

Philosophy allows us to question whether every step of this "observation" is reflective of the "real world" (or if that term is even meaningful), but it casts no more doubt as to whether that real world was collapsed the instant the photon hit the detector (the true observer, according to my argument) than it casts doubt to every other step in this process. The true philosophical question is not whether or not biology birthed the universe, but whether or not the universe existed before I was born. Philosophy equally questions whether the memory I have of the previous second (writing this sentence at one point and editing it as I write this parenthetical) actually happened or whether that memory was formed into my mind by Descartes demon.

Biocentrism claims that the universe was an unobserved blob before biology encountered it (for this concept taken to the most extreme, please read Greg Egan's [Quarantine](https://www.amazon.com/Quarantine-Novel-Greg-Egan/dp/1597805386/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1479950388&sr=8-12&keywords=quarantine), where humanity is the only source of quantum collapse and our radio telescopes threaten to genocide the rest of the universe). This I would respect as in-discussable, what Wittgenstein claims must be passed over in silence. But as with all philosophies that separate life as magical and distinct from the rest of reality, biocentrism raises many questions without really answering any. How does inanimate matter gain this ability? Was there some halfway point where dead material was only able to half collapse the universe (as evolution's slow pace would necessitate)? If life on earth was destroyed would the universe revert back to such a state? If life reappeared else where in the universe would they say the universe existed in an alternate collapsed and uncollapsed states with the ebb and flow? If we invent super intelligences with trillions of networked camera eyes, are we at danger of collapsing the universe even further and genociding humanity? The environmentalist and the humanitarian me demands that we all close our eyes!

To me biocentrism, like all anthropocentric philosophies, is defeated by cosmology. Looking back into time at distant galaxies and finally background radiation we see no hint that we are in an elevated position in the cosmos. We certainly aren't the first life in the universe, but the cosmic background radiation is so uniform that it defies explanation by the smartest humans to date. If biocentrism were true we'd certainly find variations in physics as life evolved sooner in some portions of the sky or others. But instead we see that for all of time planets, stars, and galaxies obey Newton's laws of boring pre-quantum physics because they are macroscopic objects. Sub-atomic particles behave differently before and after observation, but these effects do not appear in the heavens because planets and stars are not quantum objects and have never been. Biocentrism demands we see a phase change, rippling out into the universe as our telescopes "observe" the cosmos. Yet its waveform clearly collapsed billions of years ago, long before we looked at it.
