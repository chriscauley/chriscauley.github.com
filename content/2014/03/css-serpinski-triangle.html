A pure css Serpinski Triangle I made. The each unit cell has three divs, and to extend the fractal one level you just add three more divs in each empty div. Each div is `width: 50%; height: 50%;` of the parent div. The divs are then floated, making a square with three squares inside of it, and the forth quadrant is empty.

Normally pure css trangles are made using elements with `width: 0; height: 0` and a border with asymetrick coloring. If you are unfamiliar with this technique, you can read more at [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/ "Pure CSS Triangle"). However, because borders can't be percentages, this doesn't work with fractals. Instead we use a square, rotated pseudo elements (the `div:before` in the above css). The parent of the pseudo element is overflow hidden. Here's the full CSS. Feel free to email me if you want to know more. I may post more on this later.
