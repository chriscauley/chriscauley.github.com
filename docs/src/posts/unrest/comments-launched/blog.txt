/* BLOCK markdown */
Two years ago I started using [django-mptt-comments](https://github.com/liberation/django-mptt-comments) on the [TXRX Labs](https://txrxlabs.org) website. A few months later I started forked it and eventually made it a separate project. Now that I am using it in a separate project (more on that in the next few months) I finally decided to package it up and release version 0.1 on pypi. This can now be installed with `pip install django-unrest-comments`, and more details on how to use the project can be found on the projects [README](https://github.com/chriscauley/django-unrest-comments/blob/master/README.md) page. To celebrate I thought I'd take a minute to explain some of the features, which I'll continue to document over time on the README document.


* Runs entirely through AJAX using riot and unrest.
* Threaded and un-threaded mode and a third "chat mode" coming soon.
* Comments rendered using markdown.
* Notification email options coming soon.

If your interested in using this library let me know and I will prioritize documentation and help with any questions.
